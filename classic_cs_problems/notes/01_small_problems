------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Fibonacci - Recursive Solution

    - Here is a basic implementation with the base case specified.

        def fib2(n):
            if n < 2:
                return n
            return fib(n-2) + fib(n-1)


    - The problem is that the call tree will grow exponentially as n gets larger.  If we
        try calling fib2(50), it will never stop running.



- Fibonacci - Use Memoization

    - 'Memoization' means storing the results of calculations so you don't have to re-compute
        them.

        MEMO = {0: 0, 1: 1}

        def fib3(n):
            if n not in MEMO:
                MEMO[n] = fib3(n-2) + fib3(n-1)
            return MEMO[n]



- Fibonacci - Automatic Memoization

    - Python has a built-in decorator for memoizing any function automagically.  This will work
        exactly the same as 'fib3'.

        from functools import lru_cache

        @lru_cache(maxsize=None)
        def fib4(n):
            if n < 2:
                return n
            return fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-1)



- Fibonacci - Iterative Solution

    - The most performant solution is the good old-fashioned iterative one.

        def fib5(n):
            if n == 0: return n
            last = 0
            next = 1
            for _ in range(1, n):
                last, next = next, last + next
            return next



- Fibonacci - Generator

    - We can use a generator to generate the sequence up to a given value.

        def fib6(n):
            yield 0
            if n > 0: yield 1
            last = 0
            next = 1
            for _ in range(1, n):
                last, next = next, last + next
                yield next



- Trivial Compression

    - If we want to store DNA data, where all we need is a sequence of characters in 
        ['A', 'C', 'G', 'T'], using a string or integer type has a lot of unnnecessary overhead.
        We could store it as a bit string instead, for instance.  In this case, we'll use 2 bits
        per character instead of 8 with a Unicode string.

        A 00
        C 01
        G 10
        T 11


    - Note that we'll use a single int to keep track of the entire bit string, since a Python int
        can be any size.



- Unbreakable Encryption

    - In this example, we encrypt a string using a one-time pad.


        Original Data \                           Key 1 (Dummy Data)
                       ---->    ENCRYPTION   ---
        Dummy Data    /            (XOR)         \---->  Key 2 (Product)



        Key 1 (Dummy Data)  \
                            ---->    DECRYPTION   ----->  Original Data
        Key 2 (Product)     /          (XOR)


    - Note that it is once again useful to put all of our byte data into a single int variable,
        since it makes it easy to perform bitwise operations on the entire bit string.


    - The 'encode' method converts a string to a sequence of UTF-8 bytes.  The 'decode' method
        converts a sequence of bytes to a string.
