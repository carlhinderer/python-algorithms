- Trees

    A tree is a hierarchical data structure.  

      Root Node    = Top node in the tree all other nodes are attached to, every tree has
                     exactly one root node

      Sub-tree     = A tree whose nodes are a descendant of some other tree

      Degree       = Total number of children of a given node
      (of a node)

      Leaf Node    = A node that doesn't have any children, a terminal node of the tree,
                     degree is always zero

      Edge         = Connection between any 2 nodes, maximum total number of edges in a tree is
                     (number_of_nodes - 1)

      Parent       = A node in the tree which has a further sub-tree is the parent node of that
                     sub-tree

      Child        = A node connected to its parent

      Sibling      = All nodes with the same parent are siblings

      Level        = Root is at node 0, each layer below it is incremented by 1

      Height       = Total number of nodes in the longest path of the tree

      Depth        = The depth of a node is the number of edges from the root of the tree to 
                     that node



- Tree Nodes

    - A tree should never have cycles.

    - A tree with no nodes is an 'empty tree'.

    - A 'binary tree' is a tree in which all nodes have 0, 1, or 2 children.

    - A tree is a 'full binary tree' if all nodes have either 0 or 2 children.

    - A tree is a 'complete binary tree' if it is completely filled, except for
        the bottom level, which is filled in left to right.



- Binary tree nodes

    class Node:
        def _init__(self, data):
            self.data = data
            self.left_child = None
            self.right_child = None


    # Create binary tree nodes
    >>> n1 = Node("root node")  
    >>> n2 = Node("left child node") 
    >>> n3 = Node("right child node") 
    >>> n4 = Node("left grandchild node")

    # Connect nodes with edges
    >>> n1.left_child = n2 
    >>> n1.right_child = n3 
    >>> n2.left_child = n4 

    # Traverse the left side of the tree
    >>> current = n1
    >>> while current:
            print(current.data)
            current = current.left_child



- Depth-first traversal

    In depth-first traversal, we traverse the tree by starting at the root, and go deeper
      into the tree as much as possible on each child, then continue to traverse the next
      sibling.

    There are 3 forms of depth-first traversal:
      1. In-order traversal
      2. Pre-order traversal
      3. Post-order traversal



- In-order traversal

    With in-order traversal, we follow these steps:
      1. We start traversing the left sub-tree and call the 'inorder' function recursively
      2. Next, we visit the root node
      3. Finally, we traverse the right sub tree and call the 'inorder' function recursively
    

    def inorder(self, root_node):
        current = root_node
        if current is None: return
        self.inorder(current.left_child)
        print(current.data)
        self.inorder(current.right_child)



- Infix notation and expression trees

    'Infix notation' is used to express arithmetic expressions where the operators are
      placed in between the operands.

      (4 + 5)


    An 'expression tree' is a special kind of binary tree that can be used to represent
      arithmetic expressions.  An in-order traversal of this tree produces an infix
      notation.

        +
       / \
      4   5        Infix notation:  4 + 5



- Pre-order traversal

    With pre-order traversal, we follow these steps:
      1. We start traversing the root node
      2. Next, we traverse the left sub-tree
      3. Next, we traverse the right sub-tree

    def preorder(self, root_node):
        current = root_node
        if current is None: return
        print(current.data)
        self.preorder(current.left_child)
        self.preorder(current.right_child)



- Prefix notation

    With 'prefix notation' (aka 'Polish notation'), the operator comes before its
      operands.  

      (+ 3 4)


    A pre-order traversal of an expression tree results in prefix notation.

          +
         / \
        -   3
       / \
      8   3         Prefix notation:  + - 8 3 3



- Post-order traversal

    With post-order traversal, we follow these steps:
      1. First, we traverse the left sub-tree
      2. Next, we traverse the right sub-tree
      3. Finally, we visit the root node

    def postorder(self, root_node):
        current = root_node
        if current is None: return
        self.postorder(current.left_child)
        self.postorder(current.right_child)
        print(current.data)



- Postfix notation

    'Postfix notation' (aka 'reverse Polish notation') places an operand after
      its operands.

          +
         / \
        -   3
       / \
      8   3         Prefix notation:  8 3 - 3 +



- Lists vs Deques

    - Internally, Python lists are implemented as arrays.  This means that growing 
        beyond the current allocation size, or inserting/removing from the beginning
        of the list is expensive.  If you have to add/remove from both sides of the
        list, use a deque.

    - Internally, Python deques are implemented as doubly linked lists.  Adding and 
        removing from both ends is fast, but looking/adding/deleting in the middle is
        slow.



- Breadth-first traversal

    With a breadth-first traversal, we traverse the root node(level 0), then all
      the nodes in level 1, then all the nodes in level 2, then all the nodes
      up to level n.

    We use a deque to do this traversal, because it allows us to both push and
      pop from both sides.  


    from collections import deque

    class Tree:
        def breadth_first_traversal(self):
            list_of_nodes = [] 
            traversal_queue = deque([self.root_node])

            while len(traversal_queue) > 0:
     	         node = traversal_queue.popleft() 
     	         list_of_nodes.append(node.data) 
     	         if node.left_child: 
                  traversal_queue.append(node.left_child) 
     	         if node.right_child: 
                  traversal_queue.append(node.right_child)

            return list_of_nodes



- Binary Search Trees

    A binary search tree has the properties:

      1. The value at any node in the tree is greater than the values in all the nodes 
           of its left sub-tree.

      2. The value at any node in the tree is less than or equal to the values of all
           the nodes of the right sub-tree.


                         5
                        / \
                       3   7
                      / \   \
                     1   4   9



- Binary Search Tree implementation

    - To find the minimum and maximum nodes, we can just go down the left and 
        right sides.  Both can be done in O(h) time, in which h is the height of
        the tree.  


    class Node:
        def __init__(self, data):
            self.data = data
            self.right_child = None
            self.left_child = None


    class BST:
        def __init__(self):
            self.root_node = None

        def find_min(self):
            current = self.root_node 
            while current.left_child: 
                current = current.left_child 
            return current

        def find_max(self):
            current = self.root_node
            while current.right_child:
                current = current.right_child
            return current



- Inserting in a BST

        def insert(self, data):
            node = Node(data)
            if self.root_node is None:
                self.root_node = node
            else:
                current = self.root_node
                parent = None
                while True:
                    parent = current
                    if node.data < parent.data:
                        current = current.left_child
                        if current is None:
                            parent.left_child = node
                            return
                    else:
                        current = current.right_child
                        if current is None:
                            parent.right_child = node
                            return
