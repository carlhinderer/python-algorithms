CH 4 - LISTS AND POINTER STRUCTURES
--------------------------------------------------------

- Arrays

    Arrays are sequential lists of data.  Each element is stored right after the previous
      one in memory.  If the array is really big and you are low on memory, this could
      be a problem.  However, accessing individual elements in them can easily be done
      in constant time.



- Pointer Structures

    Pointer structures can be spread out in memory, because each item contains links to
      other items in the structure.  Their biggest advantages are that they don't require
      sequential storage space, and they can start small and grow bigger as you need 
      them to.



- Simple Node Class

    class Node:
        def __init__(self, data=None):
            self.data = data
            self.next = None

        def __str__(self):
            return str(data)



- Types of Lists

    There are 3 types of lists:
      1. Singly linked list
      2. Doubly linked list
      3. Circular linked list



- Singly linked lists

    >>> n1 = Node('eggs')
    >>> n2 = Node('ham')
    >>> n3 = Node('spam')

    >>> n1.next = n2
    >>> n2.next = n3

    >>> current = n1
    >>> while current:
            print(current.data)
            current = current.next



- Singly linked list class

    class SinglyLinkedList:
        def __init__(self):
            self.tail = None         # Tail is first node in our list

        def append(self, data):
            node = Node(data)
            if self.tail = None
                self.tail = node
            else:
                current = self.tail
                while current.next:
                    current = current.next
                current.next = node


    # Create a list
    >>> words = SinglyLinkedList()
    >>> words.append('egg')
    >>> words.append('ham')
    >>> words.append('spam')

    # Traverse the list
    >>> current = words.tail
    >>> while current:
            print(current.data)
            current = current.next



- Faster append operation

    The naive implementation of appending runs in O(n) time.  In order to make it run in
      O(1) time, we keep track of both the head and tail of the list.


    def SinglyLinkedList:
        def __init__(self, data):
            self.head = None          # Head is the latest added node in our list
            self.tail = None

        def append(self, data):
            node = Node(data)
            if self.head:
                self.head.next = node
                self.head = node
            else:
                self.tail = node
                self.head = node



- Keeping track of list size

    We could traverse the list to get the size if we want:

    def size(self):
        count = 0
        current = self.tail
        while current:
            count += 1
            current = current.next
        return count


    However, to avoid having the count take O(n) time, we can just keep track of it as we
      go along.

    class SinglyLinkedList:
        def __init__(self):
            ...
            self.count = 0

        def append(self, data):
            ...
            self.size += 1



- Improving list traversal

    To abstract the node class from the client, we can add an iterator for traversing the
      list.

    def iter(self):
        current = self.tail
        while current:
            val = current.data
            current = current.next
            yield val


    # Use the iterator
    for word in words.iter():
        print(word)



- Deleting nodes

    The delete operation takes O(n) time.

    def delete(self, data):
        current = self.tail
        prev = self.tail
        while current:
            if current.data == data:
                if current == self.tail:
                    self.tail = current.next
                else:
                    prev.next = current.next
                self.count -= 1
                return
            prev = current
            current = current.next



- Searching the list

    We can use the 'iter' method we just wrote to search the list.

    def search(self, data):
        for node in self.iter():
            if data == node:
                return True
        return False



- Clearing a list

    def clear(self):
        self.tail = None
        self.head = None



- Doubly linked lists

    Doubly linked lists keep pointers to the nodes both before and after them, so they can
      be traversed in either direction.

    class Node(object):
        def __init__(self, data=None, next=None, prev=None):
            self.data = data
            self.next = next
            self.prev = prev


    class DoublyLinkedList(object):
        def __init__(self):
            self.head = None       # Here the head points to the first node in the list
            self.tail = None       # Here the tail points to the latest added node
            self.count = 0



- Appending to doubly linked lists

    def append(self, data):
        new_node = Node(data, None, None)
        if self.head is None:
            self.head = new_node
            self.tail = self.head
        else:
            new_node.prev = self.tail
            self.tail.next = new_node
            self.tail = new_node
        self.count += 1



- Deleting from a doubly linked list

    There are 4 possible cases for deleting a node:
      1. The item to be deleted is not found in the list
      2. The item to be deleted is found at the start of the list
      3. The item to be deleted is found at the end of the list
      4. The item to be deleted is in the middle of the list


    def delete(self, data):
        current = self.head
        node_deleted = False

        if current is None:                 # Item is not found in the list
            node_deleted = False
        elif current.data == data:          # Item at the beginning of the list
            self.head = current.next
            self.head.prev = None
            node_deleted = True
        elif self.tail.data == data:        # Item is at end of list
            self.tail = self.tail.prev
            self.tail.next = None
            node_deleted = True
        else:
            while current:                  # Check middle of list
                if current.data == data:
                    current.prev.next = current.next
                    current.next.prev = current.prev
                    node_deleted = True
                current = current.next

        if node_deleted: self.count -= 1



- Searching a doubly linked list

    We can search the same way we do with a singly linked list.

    def contain(self, data):
        for node in self.iter():
            if data == node:
                return True
        return False



- Circular lists

    A circular linked list is a special case of a linked list.  In a circular linked list, 
      the endpoints are connected to each other.  Circular can be either singly or doubly
      linked.  

      |------------------------------------------|
      |   --------      --------      --------   |
      |---| Data |      | Data |      | Data | <-|
          | Prev | <--- | Prev | <--- | Prev |
      |-> | Next | ---> | Next | ---> | Next | --|
      |   --------      --------      --------   |
      |     A             B              C       |
      -------------------------------------------|


    We can reuse most of our original 'SinglyLinkedList' class to implement our singly linked
      circular list.



- Appending to a circular list

    To append an element to a circular list, we just have to make sure that the newly added
      node points back to the tail node.

    def append(self, data):
        node = Node(data)
        if self.head:
            self.head.next = node
            self.head = node
        else:
            self.head = node
            self.tail = node

        self.head.next = self.tail
        self.size += 1



- Deleting from a circular list

    When we are looping through a circular list, we can't just check for None, since
      the end node points back to the first node.  

    def delete(self, data):
        current = self.tail
        prev = self.tail
        while prev == current or prev != self.head:
            if current.data == data:
                if current == self.tail:
                    self.tail = current.next
                    self.head.next = self.tail
                else:
                    prev.next = current.next
                self.size -= 1
                return
            prev = current
            current = current.next



- Iterating through a circular list

    When iterating through a circular list, we just need to make sure we stop once we've
      gone through all the nodes.
