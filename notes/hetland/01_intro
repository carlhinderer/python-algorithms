--------------------------------------------------------

- What This Book is About

    1. Algorithm analysis
    2. Basic principles of algorithm design
    3. How to represent commonly used data structures in Python
    4. How to implement well-known algorithms in Python


  What This Book Covers Only Briefly

    1. Algorithms that are already directly available in Python
    2. Thorough and deep formalism


  What This Book Isn't About

    1. Numerical or number-theoretical algorithms
    2. Parallel algorithms and multicore programming



- First Experiment

    # Add numbers to list, then reverse it
    # Runs in linear time

    >>> count = 10**5
    >>> nums = []
    >>> for i in range(count):
            nums.append(i)
    >>> nums.reverse()


    # Instead of reversing at the end, insert numbers at beginning
    # Runs in quadratic time

    >>> for i in range(count):
            nums.insert(0, i)
